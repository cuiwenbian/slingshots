## (0) Project Name and Team Slack Handles

-Project Name：Touchain-Alpha
-Team Slack Handles：Wesley   contact：zhouyachi@touchain.io

## (1) Brief Project Description

**A user's data management tool (mobile dapp), composed of DID (Decentralized identity), Decentralized Wallet, cloud disk, etc., It help users manage their own data assets (digital assets and data rights confirmation / capitalization / transaction).**

## (2) Link to Project UI

## (3) What does your application/UI do?

-1. File management: add, delete, modify and query. Users can freely choose local storage and upload to IPFs or other cloud disks

-2.User personal data management, data right confirmation and transaction based on decentralized identity

-3. Digital asset management
 

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

- We will give priority to the data in the  [list of curated datasets in this repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slingshot/blob/master/datasets.md) for some store and retrieval tests, but if it is slow to obtain the data in the datasets due to network reasons, we will consider switching the test source. Of course, we will submit  PR to the datasets.

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

- We will give priority to the data in the  [list of curated datasets in this repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slingshot/blob/master/datasets.md) for some store and retrieval tests

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

-It's difficult to accurately assess, It depending on how many people to use our app and the files they upload, we will try our best to make the experience better so that more people can use it. Our first phase goal is 100T

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

-It can be structured data or unstructured data, and personal file data can be any type. This is a big challenge. We will start with data that is relatively simple to process

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

 -It is mainly the user's personal data, which can be personal genetic data, health records, work logs, audio-visual files, professional documents, and other files that they are willing to be shared or stored. Different documents may need different processing methods to achieve the most effective, we are still exploring

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

- Textile Hub

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

-A search bar is placed at the top of the data management interface, which is divided into local search / IPFs search and online disk search (such as Baidu disk). Users can search the content they are interested in。How long to search and the amount of retrieval depends on the different needs of each user

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

-Personal people

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

-NO ，but We will soon have 200 Angel users do the app internal test next month, in order to improve our app functions。

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

-Technical implementation, Whether the speed of searching and downloading files can meet user's need。
