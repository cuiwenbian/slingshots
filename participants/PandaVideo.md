## (3) What does your application/UI do?
- Give us a brief description of what your application/UI does？
PandaVideo will be a video entertainment and interactive platform, and may develop into a streaming media service platform in the future. Users can publish the created videos to the Internet to get more rewards. At the same time, due to the existence of payment, the quality of the videos will be very attractive to users who watch the videos. In the future, PandaVideo will use Filecoin's incentive model to gain more users and content creators.

- How users are intended to interact with it？
In the first version, users can upload content created by themselves and watch and download content already on the platform. More user system, interaction and community functions will be added in the follow-up.

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?
We use [Condensed Movies](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/condensed-movies/).

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.
We are the official data set used.

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?
It is estimated that we will upload over 100 terabytes of data to Filecoin network. This requires us to work hard to gather resources.

## (7) How are you structuring the data?
Is this structured data or unstructured data? What data format, structure, etc. does this data set follow?
Our data is unstructured data, the data format is MP4, AVI, etc.

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?
We will upload files through Powergate and Lotus. Each file is within 1GiB, and the file data information directory path data or table field information will be stored in the centralized server db, and specific data can be retrieved by cid, name and time.

## (9) What tech stack will you use to store the data?
We use the Powergate and Lotus.

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?
Retrieve data for users through the field information provided by the centralized service DB and through the Filecoin API.

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?
Users who are interested in videos and movies, as well as video creators and movie secondary processors, will also have great interest.

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?
In the current market, short video users are a very large potential blue ocean market, and we believe that after the project is launched, it will soon gain a large user scale. our plan:
- Obtain a large number of loyal users through the community in the early stage;
- In the mid-term or through the advertising platform to promote the project, gain user growth;
- Through the self-operation of the product itself, users can carry out fission growth.

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?
The video field needs users' ugc content very much. We need to think about user marketing methods and encourage users to provide us with data. This is what we need to overcome. We need to spend energy on marketing creativity.
How to get users to recognize and trust products in the decentralized way of blockchain is the direction we need to think about.
