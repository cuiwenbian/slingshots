*Our users store data as images.*

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

*We plan to store more than 1 million images on the IPFS network, with individual pieces not exceeding 5MB.*

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

*Our image data supports png, jpg and gif.*

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

*Users to upload pictures to our system, we will be the user's fingerprint information fusion to the image, guarantee the user's all rights reserved, finally upload images containing information user rights to ipfs network, will eventually cid saved into the database, for the user authorization after the pictures, we through authentication mechanism to be Shared with access permissions.*
