## (3) What does your application/UI do?

*The owner of a music could share it with some benefit, it is a new way to get benefit from music in DDMusic, different from all the music economy we can see in present. For examplem, you could share your music to a mobile game maker in DDMusic, when this game goes online and makes income, DDMusic will split some income to you as how important your music to the game.
In the next step, we will build DDFile and DDApplication base on DD-IPFS, DD-IPFS is the whole plan. At that time we will see how magic things heppen, one should just make the music and share it, then no need to worry about the intellectual property, and the income would appear automatically.
