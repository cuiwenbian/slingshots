## (3) What does your application/UI do?
Give us a brief description of what your application/UI does？
Users can publish their daily life through PicBar, or exquisite pictures seen in other places, such as landscapes or academic ones. Other users can browse and download.

How users are intended to interact with it？
In the first version, users can upload pictures created by themselves and watch and download pictures already on the platform. More user system, interaction and community functions will be added in the follow-up.

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?
We use [Open Images Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html).

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.
The official data set we use.

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?
It is estimated that we will upload more than 1-10TB of data to the Filecoin network. This requires us to work hard to collect resources.

## (7) How are you structuring the data?
We know that the data is unstructured to the data, and the data format is img, jpeg, etc.

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?
We will upload files through Powergate combined with Lotus. Each file is within 100M. The file data information directory path data or form field information will be stored in the centralized server db, and specific data can be retrieved by cid, name and time.

## (9) What tech stack will you use to store the data?
We use Powergate and Lotus.

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?
Retrieve data for users through the field information provided by the centralized service DB and through the Filecoin API.

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?
Our target users are those who have storage needs for the pictures recorded in their daily lives, and hope to store the content of these pictures permanently. They need a large-capacity tool to store the beautiful fragments recorded in their lives to release Their phone memory.

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?
The Internet product we are currently operating has a potential of 1 million users who can be attracted to this product through the form of advertising jumps.
In the early stage, we will push this product to our existing customer base through advertising and product internal implantation. I believe most of them who are interested in smoothly storing their good memories will convert to this product. Come up, this will accumulate a large number of users for our products.

Later products are recognized by users. Based on our current product promotion experience, we will also look for users with such needs for advertising to expand our user base.

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?
First of all, we have many competitors in the field of image storage. We need to perfect our product experience so that the product itself can beat the competition.

Secondly, expanding the number of users is a challenge for us. We originally have a wealth of potential users, but we need to improve them to get them to trust our products.
