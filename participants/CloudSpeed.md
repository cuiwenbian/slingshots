## (3) What does your application/UI do?

*Share files anytime, anywhere.*

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

*Movie video scenery picture user application, science and technology literature education material and so on.*

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

*Our users could store and share any type files they like. *

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

*We plan to store more than 1 million files on the Filecoin network, with individual pieces not exceeding 5GB.*

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

*For any data larger than 32GB, we will adopt the method of slicing, but the user will still be presented with a complete file. At the same time, we will define different storage areas according to the file type, such as picture area, video area, document area, etc.*

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

*Users to upload pictures to our system, we will be the user's fingerprint information fusion to the image, guarantee the user's all rights reserved, finally upload images containing information user rights to ipfs network, will eventually cid saved into the database, for the user authorization after the pictures, we through authentication mechanism to be Shared with access permissions.*

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

*Powergate, Dotnet Core*

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

*First of all, the user can set the verification code, and users with the verification code can download this file. Users can also retrieve and download from any filecoin compatible platform through datacid.*

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

*All users who want to share their file..*

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

*We already have a group of users, including programmer, photographers, operation and maintenance engineer, etc., currently stored in our own distributed storage cloud disk. The current data is close to 180T, and we plan to gradually synchronize this data to the Filecoin network in batches.*

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

*We need to solve the problem of uploading and sharing more and larger files. At the same time, each file has a unique fingerprint to ensure that they do not upload repeatedly. At the same time, we need to protect the rights and interests of the sharers.*
